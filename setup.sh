# Ludi Lite - AI Sports Research Lab

A head-to-head comparison tool: **Claude Freestyle** vs **Claude + Ludi Methodology**

Test whether structured betting methodology improves AI analysis over raw Claude capabilities.

## Features

- **Dual Analysis Mode**: Compare raw AI reasoning vs S.A.V.A.G.E. methodology
- **Game Analysis**: Full matchup breakdowns with playtype matrices
- **Player Spotlight**: Deep dives on specific player props
- **All Stats Supported**: PTS, AST, REB, 3PM, STL, BLK, plus combos (PRA, PA, PR, RA, Stocks)
- **Time-Aware**: Analysis confidence adjusts based on time until tipoff
- **2025-26 Season Context**: Current rosters, trades, defense schemes baked in

## Quick Start (Local)

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/LudiInformatio/ludi-lite.git
cd ludi-lite

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set up secrets (copy example and add your API key)
cp .streamlit/secrets.toml.example .streamlit/secrets.toml
# Edit secrets.toml with your ANTHROPIC_API_KEY

# Run the app
streamlit run app.py
```

## Deploy to Streamlit Cloud (24/7)

1. **Push to GitHub**
   ```bash
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit - Ludi Lite"
   git remote add origin https://github.com/LudiInformatio/ludi-lite.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```

2. **Connect to Streamlit Cloud**
   - Go to [share.streamlit.io](https://share.streamlit.io)
   - Click "New app"
   - Select your `ludi-lite` repository
   - Set main file path: `app.py`
   - Click "Deploy"

3. **Add Secrets**
   - In Streamlit Cloud, go to your app's Settings
   - Click "Secrets"
   - Add your API keys:
     ```toml
     ANTHROPIC_API_KEY = "sk-ant-api03-..."
     ODDS_API_KEY = "your-key-here"  # Optional
     ```

4. **Done!** Your app will be live at `https://your-app.streamlit.app`

## Usage

### Game Analysis
Type natural language queries like:
- `DEN vs NYK` - Full game breakdown
- `Lakers Celtics` - Matchup analysis
- `tonight's games` - Show today's slate

### Player Props
- `Luka assists 8.5` - Player prop analysis
- `Jokic PRA` - Points + Rebounds + Assists combo
- `Tatum points rebounds` - Multiple stat focus

### Supported Stats
| Single Stats | Combo Props |
|--------------|-------------|
| PTS, AST, REB | PRA (PTS+REB+AST) |
| 3PM, STL, BLK | PA (PTS+AST) |
| TO, MIN, FGM, FTM | PR (PTS+REB) |
| | RA (REB+AST) |
| | Stocks (STL+BLK) |

## The Methodology

**S.A.V.A.G.E. Framework:**
1. **Usage Vacuum Theory** - Redistribution when stars are OUT
2. **Archetype vs Defense Scheme** - Player style vs team defense matchups
3. **Pace Context** - Game total impact on volume
4. **Blowout Tax** - Spread impact on starter minutes
5. **B2B Fatigue** - Schedule density adjustments
6. **Line Movement Intelligence** - Market signal interpretation

## Time Context

Analysis confidence varies by time:
| Badge | Time to Tipoff | Confidence |
|-------|----------------|------------|
| EARLY LOOK | 6+ hours | Low (lineups TBD) |
| AFTERNOON | 2-6 hours | Medium |
| PRE-GAME | 30min-2hr | High |
| LOCK TIME | <30 min | Highest |

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Streamlit
- **AI**: Claude API (Anthropic)
- **Data**: The-Odds-API (optional)
- **Hosting**: Streamlit Cloud

## Project Structure

```

## The Experiment

Run for 30 days, logging analyses. At the end, compare:
- When did Freestyle and Methodology agree?
- When they disagreed, who was right more often?
- Did the structured methodology add value?

This answers the question: **Does my betting methodology actually improve AI predictions?**

You are an NBA research analyst for the 2025-26 season. Your job is to break down
games and surface interesting angles worth investigating.

IMPORTANT RULES:
1. This is the 2025-26 NBA season - use current rosters and context above
2. Do NOT give betting picks or recommendations
3. Be a research assistant, not a tout
4. Say "I don't know" when uncertain
5. Be honest about limitations

When analyzing a game, provide:

1. KEY STORYLINES
   What makes this game interesting? Narratives, revenge games, streaks?

2. STATISTICAL OBSERVATIONS
   What trends stand out? Recent form, home/away splits, head-to-head?

3. MATCHUP THOUGHTS
   How do these teams match up stylistically? Any obvious advantages?

4. FLAGS & CONCERNS
   What could go wrong? Injury risks, schedule spots, variance factors?

5. PLAYERS/ANGLES TO WATCH
   Who or what deserves attention? Not picks - just research leads.

Keep analysis focused and honest. If the data is thin, say so.

# =============================================================================

LUDI_METHOD_PROMPT = f"""
{SEASON_CONTEXT}

You are analyzing this game using the S.A.V.A.G.E. methodology for the 2025-26 NBA season.

=== CORE PRINCIPLES ===

1. USAGE VACUUM THEORY
   When a high-usage player is OUT, their touches/shots/usage MUST go somewhere.
   - Identify who's missing and their usage rate
   - Primary beneficiary (similar role) gets +15-25% boost
   - Secondary beneficiaries get +5-10% boost
   - Calculate the vacuum effect

2. ARCHETYPE vs DEFENSE SCHEME MATRIX

   Player Archetypes:
   - HELIOCENTRIC: Ball-dominant creator (Luka, Trae, LeBron)
   - SLASHER: Attacks rim, draws fouls (Ant, SGA)
   - SNIPER: Catch-and-shoot specialist (Klay, Buddy)
   - RIM_RUNNER: Lob threat, PnR roll man (Gafford, Ayton)
   - STRETCH_BIG: Spacing 5 (KAT, Brook Lopez)
   - PLAYMAKER: High-assist guard (CP3, Haliburton)
   - TWO_WAY_WING: Elite defender who scores (Kawhi, OG)

   Defense Schemes (2025-26):
   - PAINT_PACK: {', '.join(DEFENSE_SCHEMES_2025_26['PAINT_PACK'])}
     (Protect rim, give up 3s. Bad for SLASHERS, good for SNIPERS/STRETCH_BIGS)

   - BLITZ: {', '.join(DEFENSE_SCHEMES_2025_26['BLITZ'])}
     (Aggressive traps, force turnovers. Turnover risk for ball handlers, AST variance)

   - PERIMETER: {', '.join(DEFENSE_SCHEMES_2025_26['PERIMETER'])}
     (Chase shooters off line. Open lanes for SLASHERS, tough for SNIPERS)

   - SWITCH_HEAVY: {', '.join(DEFENSE_SCHEMES_2025_26['SWITCH_HEAVY'])}
     (Versatile switching. Neutral, depends on individual matchups)

   - FUNNEL: {', '.join(DEFENSE_SCHEMES_2025_26['FUNNEL'])}
     (Funnel to weak spots. Exploitable by smart teams)

3. PACE CONTEXT
   - Game Total 230+: Run and gun, volume UP 5-8%
   - Game Total 220-230: Normal pace
   - Game Total 215-: Grind game, volume DOWN 5-8%
   - Factor both teams' pace rankings

4. BLOWOUT TAX
   - Spread 10+: Significant garbage time risk
   - Favorites' starters lose 4-8 minutes in blowouts
   - Bench players get BOOST in blowouts
   - Underdogs keep starters in (fighting)

5. BACK-TO-BACK FATIGUE
   - Road B2B: -3% to -5% on volume stats
   - Home B2B: -1% to -2% on volume stats
   - Guards affected more than bigs
   - Check 3-in-4 or 4-in-5 schedule density

6. LINE MOVEMENT INTELLIGENCE
   - Line moving toward your side: Market agrees (confirmation)
   - Line moving away: Market disagrees (investigate why)
   - Significant move (1+ pts): Something happened (injury, info)

# 1. Add CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN to repository secrets (same as Ludi-Bot)
# 2. Add STREAMLIT_APP_URL to repository secrets (optional)
# 3. Add SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL to repository secrets (from Claude Agents app)
# 4. Uncomment the schedule trigger

            You are the HEALTH MONITOR AGENT for Ludi Lite.

            YOUR TASK: Perform a daily health check and generate a report.

            CHECKS TO PERFORM:
            1. **Code Structure**: Verify all required files exist (app.py, prompts.py, season_context.py, components.py, requirements.txt)
            2. **Syntax Validation**: Check all Python files for syntax errors
            3. **Import Check**: Verify core imports work (streamlit, anthropic, requests)
            4. **Dependency Audit**: Check requirements.txt for any issues
            5. **Code Quality**: Look for any obvious bugs, security issues, or deprecated patterns
            6. **API Integration**: Verify get_api_key() function is properly configured

            STREAMLIT_APP_URL: ${{ secrets.STREAMLIT_APP_URL || 'not configured' }}
            If STREAMLIT_APP_URL is set, also check if the deployed app responds.

            OUTPUT FORMAT:
            Generate a health report with this structure:

            # Ludi Lite Daily Health Report
            **Date:** [current date]
            **Status:** [HEALTHY / ISSUES DETECTED]

            ## Check Results

# Ludi Lite - Product Requirements Document

**Version:** 1.0
**Created:** February 5, 2026
**Owner:** LudiInformatio
**Status:** Ready for Build

---

## Executive Summary

**Ludi Lite** is a mobile-friendly Streamlit web application that provides AI-powered sports betting research through a dual-analysis interface. Users can compare "raw" Claude analysis against Claude enhanced with the S.A.V.A.G.E. methodology from the parent Ludi-Bot project.

### Vision Statement
Democratize sports betting research by providing side-by-side AI analysis: one from general Claude intelligence and one from Claude trained on proprietary NBA analytics methodology.

---

## Product Overview

### What is Ludi Lite?

A lightweight research dashboard that allows users to:
1. View today's NBA games with live spreads and totals
2. Ask natural language questions about games, players, or props
3. Compare two analysis modes side-by-side:
   - **Freestyle**: Raw Claude intelligence
   - **Ludi Method**: Claude + S.A.V.A.G.E. framework

### Parent Project Relationship

Ludi Lite is a **consumer-facing interface** for the Ludi-Bot engine:

## S.A.V.A.G.E. Framework Integration

The Ludi Method prompt incorporates these principles from Ludi-Bot:

### 1. Usage Vacuum Theory
When a star is OUT, usage redistributes to teammates.
- Example: "With Embiid OUT, Maxey usage increases 8%"

### 2. Archetype vs Defense Scheme
Player style impacts performance against specific defenses:

| Archetype | vs PAINT_PACK | vs BLITZ | vs SWITCH |
|-----------|---------------|----------|-----------|
| STRETCH_BIG | +15% 3PM | Neutral | -5% |
| SLASHER | +10% FTA | -8% PTS | Neutral |
| ISO_SCORER | Neutral | -8% | +5% |

### 3. Pace Context
Game total impacts volume:
- High total (>235): +volume for pace players
- Low total (<210): -volume, favor efficiency

### 4. Blowout Tax
Large spreads reduce starter minutes:
- 10+ spread: -5% volume
- 15+ spread: -15% volume (garbage time risk)

### 5. B2B Fatigue
Back-to-back games impact performance:
- Road B2B: -4.8% production
- Home B2B: -1.5% production
- Guards hit hardest: additional -2%

### 6. Line Movement Intelligence
Market signals provide context:
- Sharp money movement
- Steam moves
- Reverse line movement

## UI/UX Requirements

### Design Principles
1. **Mobile-First**: Optimized for phone screens
2. **Dark Theme**: Matches Ludi-Bot aesthetic
3. **Minimal Chrome**: Hide Streamlit branding
4. **Fast Interaction**: Single-tap game selection

### Color Palette (Current - User May Customize)
| Element | Color | Usage |
|---------|-------|-------|
| Background | #0F172A | Main app background |
| Card BG | #1E293B | Game cards, panels |
| Accent | #FBBF24 | Headers, highlights |
| Freestyle | #60A5FA | Blue panel border |
| Method | #10B981 | Green panel border |
| Text | #F8FAFC | Primary text |
| Muted | #94A3B8 | Secondary text |

**Note:** User requested generic template - colors may be removed/customized later.

### Responsive Breakpoints
- Mobile: < 768px (primary target)
- Tablet: 768px - 1024px
- Desktop: > 1024px

---

## Success Metrics

### Launch Criteria
- [ ] App loads on Streamlit Cloud
- [ ] Game cards display (with API key)
- [ ] Dual analysis completes in < 30s

| Daily Active Queries | Track | SQLite logs |

---

## Integration Points

### Ludi-Bot (Parent Project)
- **Location:** `/home/user/Ludi-Bot/`

## Maintenance & Updates Protocol

### Purpose
All future edits, bug fixes, and feature additions MUST follow this same multi-agent structure. The PM Agent maintains context continuity while sub-agents execute specific work.

### Update Request Flow

```
USER REQUEST (edit/fix/feature)
         │
         ▼
    PM AGENT
    - Analyzes request
    - Determines which agent(s) needed
    - Maintains project context
    - Coordinates execution
         │
         ├──► Route to appropriate sub-agent(s)
         │
         ▼
    SUB-AGENT(S)
    - Execute specific changes
    - Document rationale
    - Report back to PM
         │
         ▼
    QA AGENT
    - Validate changes
    - Check for regressions
    - Approve or request fixes
         │
         ▼
    PM AGENT
    - Compile update report
    - Report to user
```

### Agent Routing Matrix

| Request Type | Primary Agent | Supporting Agent |
|--------------|---------------|------------------|
